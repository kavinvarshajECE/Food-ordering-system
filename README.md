Creating a "Food Ordering System" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves building a web application where users can select food items, customize their orders, and place an order. Here’s a basic outline of what such a project might include:

HTML:

Structure: Create the basic structure with elements like headers, menus, order forms, and checkout sections.
Forms: Use forms to capture user inputs like food selection, quantity, and customization options.
CSS:

Styling: Design the layout and aesthetics of the page. This includes styling the menu, buttons, and order summary to make the interface appealing and user-friendly.
Responsive Design: Ensure the site looks good on various devices by using responsive design techniques.
JavaScript:

Interactivity: Implement functionality to handle user actions such as selecting items, updating quantities, and calculating totals.
Dynamic Updates: Use JavaScript to dynamically update the order summary and reflect changes based on user input.
Validation: Validate user input to ensure that orders are properly placed and to handle errors or incomplete submissions.
Additional Features:

Cart System: Create a cart where users can view selected items, modify quantities, or remove items.
Order Summary: Display a summary of the order with details like item names, quantities, prices, and total cost.
Checkout Process: Implement a checkout process where users can enter their details and confirm the order.
By combining these technologies, you can build a functional and interactive food ordering system.
